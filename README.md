# Sukkanama Vehicle Renting System
## Description
Sukkanama is a vehicle rental system developed using React Vite. This platform provides a seamless experience for both vehicle owners and renters.

   - Vehicle Owners: Can list their vehicles for rent by posting ads with details such as price, availability, and vehicle specifications.

   - Renters (Vehicle Finders): Can browse available vehicles, view detailed descriptions, and book rentals efficiently.

This project is part of our final-year coursework at NIBM, developed collaboratively by a team of four members.
